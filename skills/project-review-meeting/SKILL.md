name: project-review-meeting
description: Generic recurring review-meeting lifecycle — schedule, agenda, pre-read pack, run/minutes, action-item filing. Reads name, attendees, cadence, agenda template, notice/minutes-distribution windows from a profile YAML in the active pack. The PIC pack ships a profile that reproduces v1.x Steering Committee behavior (Appendix A agenda, 5-business-day notice + 5-business-day minutes, four designate roles, quarterly minimum, PIC PM as non-voting). Other packs ship board-meeting, customer QBR, sprint-retro profiles. Use whenever the user says 'schedule the next [SC/board/QBR/retro]', 'review meeting', 'meeting pack', 'meeting agenda', 'distribute minutes', 'action items from the meeting', or any request to handle a recurring review meeting. Replaces v1.x project-sc-meeting; that name remains an alias if the PIC pack is loaded.

# Project Review Meeting (v2.0 — was project-sc-meeting)

Lifecycle for any recurring review meeting where decisions get made, status gets reported, and action items get filed. Steering Committees are the grant-world case; board meetings, customer QBRs, sprint retros, exec reviews, and partner check-ins are others.

The skill itself is generic. Meeting-shape comes from the profile loaded by the active pack:

- **PIC pack** profile (`packs/pic-pcais/profiles/review-meeting.yaml`) — name "Steering Committee", PIC PM Guide Appendix A agenda, 5-business-day notice minimum, 5-business-day minutes distribution window, the four designate roles (Project Lead / Finance Rep / Communications Rep / Signing Authority per consortium member), PIC PM as non-voting attendee, quarterly minimum cadence.
- **Board-investor pack** profile — name "Board Meeting", monthly cadence, board pack template, board-member roster.
- **Client-services pack** profile — name "Quarterly Business Review", quarterly cadence, customer attendees, QBR pack template.
- **Agile-default pack** profile — name "Sprint Retrospective", sprint cadence, team attendees, retro template.

## What it owns

- Scheduling per the profile's cadence + notice rules
- Agenda assembly from the profile's template plus current substrate state
- Pre-read pack assembly (status reporter output + decisions log + risk register slice)
- Calendar invite drafts (via `project-notifier`)
- Minutes capture (manual or transcript-fed) and distribution within the profile's window
- Action-item filing as tasks linked to the meeting record

## What it does not own

- Running the meeting itself
- Defining the agenda template — that's in the pack
- Sending invites — calendar items are proposed holds for human send
- Sending minutes — Gmail items are always drafts

## Profile shape

  - decisions.recently-recorded
```

## Migration from v1.x

The v1.x `project-sc-meeting` skill is renamed to `project-review-meeting`. The PIC pack ships a profile that reproduces the SC behavior exactly. If you load only the PIC pack, your existing SC-001, SC-002, … records are unchanged and the skill still produces Appendix-A-formatted packs.

For projects loading non-PIC packs, the meeting name and shape come from those packs' profiles. Multiple meeting kinds (SC + board + QBR) coexist by being separate entries in the stakeholder reporting matrix with different generators.
