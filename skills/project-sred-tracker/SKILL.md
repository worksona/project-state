description: "Continuous SR&ED work capture for Canadian T661 claims. Records technological uncertainties (TUs), experiments (EXs), technological advancements (ADVs), and contemporaneous evidence entries into sred/ substrate. Enforces TU→EX→ADV traceability. Runs gap analysis and quarterly completeness reviews. Active when sred-canada pack is loaded. Use whenever the user says 'record a technical uncertainty', 'log SR&ED work', 'add an experiment', 'capture an advancement', 'SR&ED evidence', 'what's our SR&ED status', 'quarterly SR&ED review', 'gap analysis', or any request to track experimental development work for CRA."

# Project SR&ED Tracker

## Purpose

Capture SR&ED-eligible work at the time it happens — not reconstructed at year-end. Every T661 claim is strengthened or weakened by the quality and timing of the underlying records. This skill is the substrate interface for all SR&ED entities in `.project-state/sred/`.

The three entity types map directly to T661 sections:
- **Technological Uncertainties (TU)** → Section E [242]
- **Experiments / Work Streams (EX)** → Section F [244]
- **Technological Advancements (ADV)** → Section G [246]

Plus the **evidence log** (`sred/evidence-log.ndjson`) — the contemporaneous record that CRA may request in an audit.

**Design principle:** capture at the time of the work. A TU record created before the experiment is far more defensible than one backdated to match the T661. The evidence log is append-only and timestamped.

## Trigger phrases

- "record a technical uncertainty" / "we have an SR&ED uncertainty"
- "log SR&ED work" / "capture experiment" / "add a work stream"
- "we found an advancement" / "record a technological advancement"
- "SR&ED evidence entry" / "log this work for SR&ED"
- "what's our SR&ED status" / "quarterly SR&ED review"
- "SR&ED gap analysis" / "are we ready for the T661"
- "how much SR&ED work have we captured"
- Any milestone completion that involved experimental development

}
```

## Operations

### `record_uncertainty(fields)`

Create a new TU-NN record. Required fields:
- `uncertainty_statement` — in CRA-preferred language ("It was uncertain whether...")
- `standard_practice_gap` — why existing knowledge didn't resolve it
- `identified_date` — ideally before experimental work begins
- `field_of_science` — CRA code
- `linked_milestones` — which project milestones involve this uncertainty

Enforce: if `identified_date` is after any linked experiment's `start_date`, warn — this is a backdating risk.

### `record_experiment(fields)`

Create a new EX-NN record. Required fields:
- `linked_tu` — must reference an existing TU-NN
- `hypothesis` — what was being tested
- `method_and_trials` — what was done (ask for this if not provided)
- `observations_and_results` — what was found
- `evidence_records` — at least one

Enforce: if `observations_and_results` is empty or sounds like pure feature delivery, warn and ask for more detail. The result must include at least one of: failure, limitation, unexpected finding, iteration, refinement.

Automatically append an entry to `sred/evidence-log.ndjson`.

### `record_advancement(fields)`

Create a new ADV-NN record. Required fields:
- `linked_tu` — must reference an existing TU-NN
- `linked_experiments` — must include at least one EX-NN
- `advancement_statement` — in CRA-preferred language ("The work established that...")

Enforce:
- Advancement must be proportionate to the linked experiments' observed results
- Language must describe knowledge gained, not product delivered
- Flag any risky language from the pack profile's `risky_language_patterns` list

### `log_evidence(fields)`

Append one entry to `sred/evidence-log.ndjson`. This is the lightweight daily capture:
```
"log SR&ED work on EX-01 today — tested three token-handling approaches, two failed"
→ append evidence entry with today's date, description, EX-01 link
```

Minimal required fields: `date`, `tu_id` or `ex_id`, `description`, `people`.

### `gap_analysis()`

Scan all TU/EX/ADV records and evidence log for completeness gaps:

| Check | Risk if failed |
|-------|---------------|
| TU with no linked EX | High — uncertainty without investigation |
| EX with no linked TU | High — work without a declared uncertainty |
| EX with no evidence_records | High — no contemporaneous records |
| EX with no observations_and_results | High — no documented outcome |
| ADV with no linked EX | High — advancement without experimental basis |
| TU identified after EX start_date | Medium — backdating appearance |
| EX completed >90 days ago with no ADV | Medium — work without declared knowledge gain |
| Evidence log entry gap >30 days for active EX | Medium — stale capture |
| Milestone with experimental description and no linked TU | Medium — potential SR&ED work uncaptured |

Return a prioritized gap list with recommended actions and deadlines.

### `quarterly_review()`

Run `gap_analysis()` and produce a structured quarterly review report:
1. SR&ED substrate summary: TU count, EX count, ADV count, evidence log entry count
2. Completeness gaps (from gap_analysis)
3. Cost allocation status: are people's time entries current?
4. 18-month deadline status: days remaining per fiscal year
5. Milestones completed since last review — any experimental work uncaptured?
6. Recommended actions before next quarter

Save to `reports/adhoc/sred-quarterly-YYYY-QN.md`. Offer to route to SR&ED lead via `project-notifier`.

### `traceability_map()`

Generate the full uncertainty → experiment → advancement chain for a given fiscal year:

```
TU-01 → EX-01 → ADV-01  ✓ complete
TU-01 → EX-02 → (no ADV) ⚠ advancement missing
TU-02 → (no EX) ✗ no experimental work recorded
```

Used as input to the evidence-map template and T661 narrative generation.

### `milestone_sred_check(milestone_id)`

Called by `project-milestone-manager` on milestone completion. Asks:
- Does this milestone involve any experimental development?
- If yes: are TU/EX records current?
- If no TU exists for this milestone: suggest creating one or confirming SR&ED non-applicability

## Discipline rules

- **Capture at the time of the work.** Evidence entries should reference dates contemporaneous with the actual work — not the date they were entered into the system. If an entry is being back-filled, note the distinction.
- **Never invent experiments or results.** If the user provides insufficient detail, ask for it. Do not generate hypotheses or observed results that the user didn't provide.
- **Never imply eligibility certainty.** This skill captures and structures information. Eligibility determinations require a qualified SR&ED consultant. Flag borderline situations clearly.
- **Enforce the traceability chain.** Every ADV must trace to a TU and an EX. The skill will not create an ADV without both links.
- **Proportionality.** Advancement claims must match the scope of the experimental evidence. Warn when an advancement sounds broader than what the linked experiments support.
- **The 18-month deadline is hard.** When it is within 180 days, surface it prominently on every SR&ED interaction.

## Integration

- **project-state** — all writes route through it; TU/EX/ADV are entities like milestones
- **project-milestone-manager** — calls `milestone_sred_check()` on completion; milestones link to TU/EX records
- **project-funder-reporting** — consumes TU/EX/ADV entities to generate T661 narrative via sred-canada pack profile
- **project-sred-reviewer** — receives the T661 draft for audit-risk review before advisor handoff
- **project-orchestrator** — quarterly review triggered via reporting matrix `sred.quarterly-log-review` entry
- **project-change-register** — significant scope changes may affect SR&ED eligibility; flag for advisor review
