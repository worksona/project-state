name: project-external-comms
description: Generic external-communication review pipeline — proposed publications, presentations, press releases, blog posts crossing the audience boundary. Reads review-window-by-content-class from a profile in the active pack. PIC pack ships profile that reproduces v1.x MPA-mandated 30-day full-publication and 14-day abstract review with PIC + ISED funding acknowledgement enforcement and patent-filing-delay coordination. Other packs ship corporate-PR profiles, customer-confidentiality profiles, etc. Use whenever the user says 'we want to publish', 'submit an abstract', 'press release', 'media interview', 'external talk', 'publication review', 'clear for external' — or any request to route external content through review. Replaces v1.x project-publications.

# Project External Comms (v2.0 — was project-publications)

The publication-review-clock pattern, generalized. Anything that crosses the project's audience boundary — papers, abstracts, presentations, press releases, blog posts marked public, marketing-side announcements — runs through this skill's review pipeline. The clock window and review authority come from the profile loaded by the active pack.

The skill itself is generic. Audience-bound review rules come from the profile:

- **PIC pack** profile (`packs/pic-pcais/profiles/external-comms.yaml`) — 30-day full publication review, 14-day abstract review, mandatory PIC + ISED + Government of Canada funding acknowledgement, patent-filing-delay coordination, SC-as-reviewer.
- **Corporate-PR pack** profile — 7-day legal review, brand-team approval, embargo coordination.
- **Client-confidentiality pack** profile — customer NDA review, sensitive-data scrubbing, customer-approval-required.

## What it owns

- Logging proposed external content with classification (paper / abstract / talk / press / blog-public)
- Starting the review clock per the profile's window-by-content-class
- Tracking review state through reviewer signoffs
- Holding the deploy/publish until the clock clears
- Funding-acknowledgement template injection (per profile)
- Confidentiality screening prompts (per profile)
- Patent-filing-delay coordination with `project-ip-tracker` (when enabled)

## What it does not own

- Authoring publications, abstracts, or press releases
- Sending material out — always stops at "cleared for external" status
- Defining the review window — that's in the profile

## Sub-actions

### `propose <content-id> <class>`
Logs a proposed external content item, starts the review clock per profile rules.

### `status <content-id>`
Reports current state: in_review / cleared / blocked + days remaining on clock.

### `clear <content-id>`
Marks reviewers' signoff complete. Once clock has elapsed AND signoffs are complete, status flips to cleared.

### `block <content-id> <reason>`
Reviewer pauses the clock. Common reasons: confidentiality concern, patent-filing in progress, missing acknowledgement.

## Migration from v1.x

`project-publications` is renamed to `project-external-comms`. The 30/14-day MPA clock survives in the PIC pack profile. Existing publication records in `publications/` are unchanged. The funding acknowledgement template (PIC + ISED) moves into the PIC pack as a referenceable fragment.

Projects without a funder/MPA can load a corporate-PR or open-source profile with different windows. Projects that publish nothing externally simply don't load any external-comms profile — the skill becomes inert.
