description: "Classify, index, and manage project documents — proposals, MPAs, signed Schedule A workbooks, PIC templates, quarterly claim forms, meeting minutes, publications, and any other file that lands in the project. Use this skill whenever the user says 'I just dropped a doc', 'classify this file', 'catalog the inbox', 'what docs do we have', 'where is the MPA', 'promote this to source of truth', 'update the document index', 'a PIC form arrived', 'archive the old proposal', 'the signed MPA is here', 'what is the source of truth for X', or any request to ingest, find, classify, or promote documents inside a `.project-state/` project. Also trigger when any project-* skill needs to reference a specific document by canonical path, or when the user drops a file into `.project-state/documents/inbox/`."

# Project Document Curator

## Purpose

Be the librarian. Every project document (docx, xlsx, pdf, md, docx) has a canonical path and metadata in `.project-state/documents/index.yaml`. When a doc arrives, classify it, give it a stable `id`, decide whether it's source-of-truth, move it to the right folder, and cross-reference it from the manifest or a phase.

Without this skill, docs pile up with ambiguous names in the project root and nobody knows what the current MPA version is.

## Trigger phrases (priority order)

1. "I just dropped [filename] into the project" / "there's a new doc"
2. "classify this file" / "catalog the inbox"
3. "where is the MPA" / "where's the latest Schedule A"
4. "promote [id] to source of truth"
5. "update the document index"
6. Any `project-*` skill fetching a document by id or kind

## State routing

All documents live under `.project-state/documents/`:

| Folder            | Contents                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inbox/`          | New arrivals awaiting classification                                    |
| `source-of-truth/`| Authoritative versions — MPA, signed Schedule A, approval letters       |
| `working/`        | Drafts in progress — claim drafts, pre-submission workbooks             |
| `published/`      | Versions delivered to PIC/Consortium (frozen)                           |
| `pic-templates/`  | PIC-provided blank templates                                            |

The index is at `documents/index.yaml`. Its schema is in `.project-state/SCHEMA.md` (see entry "Document registry").

## The classification decision

When a doc lands, answer these five questions in order:

1. **What kind?** → map to an enum:
   - `mpa` (signed Master Project Agreement)
   - `mpa-template`
   - `schedule-a-workbook` (signed) or `schedule-a-template`
   - `proposal` (submitted full proposal)
   - `approval-letter`
   - `financial-assessment` (step 1 or step 2)
   - `pic-template` (any blank PIC form)
   - `capital-cost-request` / `foreign-cost-request`
   - `change-order` (filled, signed) — but also indexed from `changes/change-orders/` YAML
   - `claim-submission` (filled xlsx submitted to PIC)
   - `sc-agenda` / `sc-minutes`
   - `monthly-brief` / `weekly-report`
   - `publication` / `presentation`
   - `ip-disclosure`
   - `annual-questionnaire`
   - `final-report`
   - `invoice` / `receipt` (expense-eligibility supporting docs)
   - `misc` (use sparingly, ask for a better classification)

2. **What phase does it belong to?** `01-loi` / `02-approval` / `03-planning` / `04-execution` / `05-closeout`. Default to the current phase.

3. **Is this source-of-truth?** An item is SoT if it is THE authoritative version of a fact for the project. The signed MPA is SoT. A pre-signing draft is NOT. A PIC approval letter is SoT. A blank PIC template is NOT. The filled and submitted Q2 claim is SoT for what was submitted; next quarter's draft is not.

4. **Does it supersede an earlier SoT?** If so, set `superseded_by` on the old entry and `supersedes` on the new one. Do not delete the old file — move it to `source-of-truth/archive/` or `published/`.

5. **What does the rest of the state need to know?** Cross-references:
   - If `mpa` (signed) → update `manifest.yaml:dates.mpa_signed`, `project.governing_document_status`
   - If `approval-letter` → update `manifest.yaml:dates.approval_date`, evidence on `phases/02-approval/manifest.yaml:gate_out.evidence`
   - If `schedule-a-workbook` signed → it becomes the authoritative source for milestones; flag the scaffolder to reconcile `milestones/` against it
   - If `sc-minutes` → link from `reports/sc-meetings/<id>.yaml`
   - If `claim-submission` → link from `reports/claims/<id>.yaml` and log `claim.submitted`

## Workflow

### On arrival (`documents/inbox/` → classified)

```
GIVEN a new file in documents/inbox/ (or user says "I added a file")
1. Read the filename and the first 500 bytes / table of contents.
2. Propose a classification (kind, phase, sot?) and show it to the user for confirmation.
3. On confirmation:
   a. Move the file to the appropriate folder (source-of-truth / working / published / pic-templates).
   b. Assign an id: "doc-<kind>-<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slug>" OR preserve an existing id pattern.
   c. Append a new entry to documents/index.yaml.
   d. If SoT and supersedes an older entry, update supersedes/superseded_by links.
   e. Update manifest.yaml cross-references where applicable (dates, governing_document_status, phase evidence).
   f. Call project-state to log document.registered (and document.sot.promoted if applicable).
4. Return the canonical path and id.
```

### Lookup (`where is X?`)

```
GIVEN a kind or slug from the user
1. Query documents/index.yaml.
2. If multiple matches, prefer the one with source_of_truth: true and no superseded_by.
3. Return (id, kind, canonical path, last_modified, sot_flag, notes).
```

### Promote (`promote to source of truth`)

```
GIVEN an existing document id
1. Confirm it isn't already SoT.
2. Move the file from working/ or published/ to source-of-truth/.
3. Update its index entry: source_of_truth: true, source_of_truth_for: [...].
4. If it supersedes a prior SoT, set the supersedes/superseded_by links.
5. Call project-state to log document.sot.promoted.
```

### Index audit (`what docs do we have?` / `audit the inventory`)

Walk every file under `documents/`. Compare to `documents/index.yaml`:
- Files in the tree not in the index → `UNINDEXED` warning
- Index entries with missing files on disk → `MISSING` warning
- SoT entries with `superseded_by` pointing nowhere → `DANGLING` warning

Return a short table: total docs, by kind, by phase, SoT count, warnings.

## Integration with other skills

- **project-state** — all writes to `documents/index.yaml` and `manifest.yaml` go through `project-state`'s locking/logging. This skill reads/writes intent; `project-state` executes.
- **project-phase-gate** — when a doc is registered that matches a gate's `required_artifacts_paths`, populate that path. If all gate artifacts are present, `project-phase-gate` can offer to transition.
- **project-status-reporter** — status reports link to SoT docs by id (never by raw filename). Renames are invisible to reports.

## Reference: current inventory snapshot

At scaffold time the index was seeded with the following source-of-truth docs:
- `doc-proposal-full` — AI Program Full Proposal (2026-03-27)
- `doc-workbook-pcais` — PCAIS Program Workbook (to be superseded by signed Schedule A)
- `doc-financial-step1` — Financial Assessment Step 1 workbook
- `doc-pic-pm-guide` — PIC Project Management Guide (May 2025)

And the following non-SoT templates:
- `doc-mpa-template`, `doc-financial-step2-template`, `doc-fca-template`, `doc-capital-cost-approval`, `doc-dcc-members`, `doc-related-party-members`

When the signed MPA arrives in `inbox/`, it will supersede nothing (there's no prior MPA), but the signed Schedule A inside it will supersede `doc-workbook-pcais` as the authoritative milestone list.
