description: "Route project artifacts to the right surface — Slack (post), Gmail (always as draft for human review), Google Calendar (events + holds), or scsiwyg (via project-blog-publisher). Use whenever the user says 'post this to Slack', 'send to the channel', 'email to PIC', 'draft an email to the consortium', 'put this on the calendar', 'schedule the SC meeting', 'ping finance rep about the claim', 'alert the team about the at-risk milestone', 'notify', or any request to push a report, reminder, or update from .project-state/ out to a surface. Never sends Gmail messages — only drafts them. Respects the surfaces config in manifest.yaml. Logs every delivery as an activity event via project-state. Used by orchestrator, status-reporter, sc-meeting, claim-prep, phase-gate whenever they produce output that needs to reach humans."

# Project Notifier

## Purpose

Centralize the "how does this artifact reach a human?" decision. Other skills produce payloads (a weekly report, a phase transition, a claim draft, an SC reminder, a risk alert). This skill routes them to Slack, Gmail, Calendar, or the scsiwyg blog.

**Design principles:**
- **Gmail is always a draft.** Never auto-send. The human reviews and sends.
- **Config is in the manifest.** Channel names, from-identities, calendar IDs live in `manifest.yaml:surfaces`. This skill reads them; it doesn't carry its own config.
- **One log entry per delivery.** Every push to a surface is an activity event.
- **Retries are cheap; idempotency matters.** Give each delivery a deterministic key so repeating the same notification doesn't double-post.

## Trigger phrases

- "post to Slack" / "send to #channel" / "ping the team"
- "email to PIC" / "draft an email to PM" / "Gmail draft"
- "calendar the SC meeting" / "put this on the calendar" / "schedule a hold"
- "alert about the at-risk milestone"
- "notify [audience] about [thing]"

## Surfaces

### Slack

Reads `manifest.yaml:surfaces.slack.channels`:
- `daily_standup` — brief daily updates
- `weekly_report` — Monday weekly report
- `alerts` — phase transitions, overdue claims, SC reminders, at-risk milestones

If a named channel is `~`, warn the caller and abort that specific surface (don't fail the whole notification).

**Uses:** the Slack MCP (`mcp__*__slack_send_message` etc.).

**Formatting rules:**
- Weekly reports: multi-block, use the report markdown; Slack handles it well.
- Alerts: compact, with "why now?" in the first line.
- Claim reminders: include the deadline in ISO-8601 and the PIC contact.

### Gmail

Reads `manifest.yaml:surfaces.gmail.from_identity` + `default_recipients`.

**Always drafts.** Uses `mcp__*__create_draft`. The user sends manually.

**Default email templates (adjust for tone):**
- PIC Project Manager: formal, per-paragraph framing matching the PIC PM Guide vocabulary
- Consortium Members: collegial, technical where relevant
- SC distribution: follow the 5-business-day minutes-distribution template

Draft subject prefix conventions:
- `[PIC Update] ` — to PIC
- `[Consortium] ` — to Consortium Members
- `[SC] ` — Steering Committee
- `[Claim Q2 2026] ` — claim-related

### Google Calendar

Reads `manifest.yaml:surfaces.google_calendar.calendar_id` + `event_prefixes`.

**Event prefixes** ensure Project-related events are visually grouped:
- `[SC] ` — Steering Committee meetings
- `[PIC Claim Due] ` — claim deadlines
- `[PIC Milestone] ` — milestone boundaries
- `[Internal] ` — team-internal reviews / standups

**Event fields:**
- `description` must include a link back to the `.project-state/` entity it's about (e.g., `reports/sc-meetings/2026-Q2-01.yaml`).
- For SC meetings: send invites to the SC designates (from `people/` files), at least 5 business days in advance.

### scsiwyg

Routed through `project-blog-publisher`, not this skill directly. If the user says "post to blog", invoke blog-publisher.

## Operations

### `notify(audience, artifact_ref, channel_hint?)`

Input: an audience label ("team", "pic-pm", "consortium", "sc", "exec") and a reference to an artifact in `.project-state/` (path or id), plus optional channel override.

Flow:
1. Resolve audience → channel(s). `audience=team + artifact=weekly report` → Slack `weekly_report` channel. `audience=pic-pm + artifact=claim draft` → Gmail draft.
2. Format the payload for the target.
3. Deliver (Slack: send; Gmail: create draft; Calendar: create event).
4. Log `notify.posted` or `notify.drafted` via project-state, with target, artifact_ref, and the resulting message/draft/event id.

### `schedule_event(title, start, end, invitees, description, prefix)`

Create a Google Calendar event with the given fields. Return the event id; log `calendar.event.created`.

Use cases:
- SC meeting — prefix `[SC] `, invite designates, include link to `reports/sc-meetings/<id>-agenda.docx`.
- Claim deadline — prefix `[PIC Claim Due] `, 1-day all-day event on Apr/Jul/Oct/Jan 20, reminder 14 days prior.
- Milestone boundary — prefix `[PIC Milestone] `, all-day on planned_end.

### `reminder(entity_id, days_before, channel)`

Set up a reminder N days before a date. Executed by `project-orchestrator` via `schedule` skill; `project-notifier` just defines the reminder payload.

## Idempotency

For each notification, compute a deterministic `delivery_key`:
```
delivery_key = sha1("{audience}|{artifact_ref}|{date}|{channel}")
```
Before delivering, check `state.json:recent_notifications[delivery_key]`. If present and dated within 6 hours, skip (the user must have already triggered it). Otherwise record it after successful delivery.

This lets `project-orchestrator` call `notify` eagerly without worrying about duplicate Monday-morning weekly posts.

## Discipline

- **Never auto-send Gmail.** If the surfaces config were ever mutated to `always_draft: false`, refuse to send and escalate. This is an MPA/PIC compliance concern.
- **Never post to public Slack channels without reviewing confidentiality.** Default all posts to internal channels; public-adjacent posts route through `project-external-comms` first.
- **Respect the MPA publication clock.** If a notification includes results that haven't cleared the 30/14-day SC review, route through `project-external-comms` first.
- **Include links, not screenshots.** Every Slack/Gmail message references the canonical `.project-state/` file by path so the recipient can click through.

## Integration

- **project-state** — reads surfaces config; writes `notify.*` events; maintains `recent_notifications` key map.
- **project-status-reporter** — biggest caller; produces weekly/SC/claim payloads.
- **project-orchestrator** — drives reminders and calendar holds on schedule.
- **project-review-meeting** — uses this for invites + minutes distribution.
- **project-funder-reporting** — uses this for deadline reminders and PIC PM draft email.
- **project-phase-gate** — phase transitions alert the team.
- **project-blog-publisher** — parallel skill for scsiwyg; shares the publication-review discipline.
