description: "Generate status reports for a grant-funded project in multiple formats — weekly report (team / Slack-format), Steering Committee pack (docx, PIC Appendix A agenda), quarterly claim draft (xlsx, PIC MS & financial tracking form), ad-hoc status prose (for email), and one-page dashboard snapshot. Use whenever the user says 'weekly report', 'draft the weekly', 'SC pack', 'prep the pack for next SC meeting', 'quarterly claim draft', 'draft Q2 claim', 'status update please', 'dashboard snapshot', 'summarize the project', 'how is the project', 'what's our status', 'send a status to PIC', or any request to produce a report from .project-state/. Reads through project-state and milestone-manager; hands off delivery to project-notifier and blog-publisher. Never sends anything — always stops at a draft for review."

# Project Status Reporter

## Purpose

Turn the structured state under `.project-state/` into readable reports in the formats the project's audiences actually consume. The project produces multiple report types on different cadences; they all draw from the same underlying facts.

**Design principle:** the report is a *view* of state. If the report is wrong, the state was wrong or the template was wrong. Reports are never a place where new facts are first recorded.

## Report catalog

## Trigger phrases

- "weekly report" / "draft the weekly" / "Monday report"
- "SC pack" / "prep next SC meeting" / "agenda for the steering committee"
- "quarterly claim" / "draft Q2 claim" / "claim for the 20th"
- "status update" / "how is the project" / "what's our status"
- "snapshot" / "dashboard" / "one-pager"
- "monthly brief" / "technical brief"
- "final report for [org]"

## Common report structure

Every report answers, in this order:

1. **Top line.** One-sentence health + phase.
2. **What's changed since last report.** Milestone progress, completions, decisions recorded, changes logged/orders raised, risks opened/closed, IP disclosures.
3. **What's up next.** Upcoming milestones, deadlines (especially claim + SC), in-flight decisions.
4. **Blockers + risks.** Anything `at_risk`, `blocked`, or overdue. Gate items still pending.
5. **Asks.** Anything the audience needs to decide or approve.

Specifics below customize this skeleton.

## Weekly report

**Inputs:**
- State summary from `project-state` (counters, health)
- Milestones from `project-milestone-manager` (in_progress + at_risk)
- Activity log tail since the last weekly (`since = state.json:pointers.last_weekly_report`)
- Gate status of current phase from `project-phase-gate`
- Upcoming deadlines (from `manifest.yaml:reporting_calendar` + milestone planned_ends)

**Output template (`reports/weekly/YYYY-Www.md`):**

```markdown
# Weekly report — YYYY-Www — Project Ai26.10

**Phase:** <current-phase-label> — <gate-status-summary>
**Overall health:** <green/yellow/red> — <one-line reason>

## Since last week
- <event, event, event — grouped by kind>

## This week's focus
- <upcoming milestones, meetings, deadlines>

## Blockers & at-risk
- <items with status in {at_risk, blocked} + gate items still pending>

## Asks
- <decisions needed, artifacts needed, approvals>

## By the numbers
| Milestones | Planned | In progress | At risk | Complete |
|------------|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| …          |         |             |         |          |

_Next claim due: <date> · Next SC meeting: <date> · Days to project end: <n>_
```

Hand off to `project-notifier` for Slack delivery. Update `state.json:pointers.last_weekly_report` + `counters.weekly_reports`.

## Steering Committee pack

**Inputs:** everything, but specifically shaped for the PIC Appendix A standard agenda (9 topics: Introduction; Review of Previous Minutes; Project Schedule/Overview/Milestones; Change Orders & Change Log; Project Finances; Publications/Media; IP Update; Regulatory Check-In; Key Contact Updates; Open Discussion / Lessons Learned; Action Steps Review; Next Meeting).

**Output:** one `.docx` following PIC's agenda format. Use `python-docx` for rendering (shared primitives with `project-doc-suite-generator`). Embed:
- Gantt-style view of milestones (status, % complete, planned vs. actual)
- Finances table (budget vs. spend — if available)
- Active risks (top 5 by score)
- Recent Change Log entries + any open Change Orders
- Publications in review / approved
- IP disclosures since last SC
- Action items from previous meeting with status

Companion `agenda.docx` is lighter — just the agenda skeleton for the 5-business-day pre-meeting distribution.

## Quarterly claim

Per PIC PM Guide: "Each project member must complete a MS and financial tracking form (provided by PIC). This form is used to assess your organization's claim submissions for the prior quarter."

**Inputs:**
- Period bounds from `claim_period(quarter)` — e.g., Q2 2026 = Apr 1 – Jun 30.
- For each milestone active in the period: `percent_complete` + `technical_progress` at period end.
- Per-member claim packages (expenses, invoices, categorization) — supplied by Finance Rep out of band; this skill assembles around them.

**Output:** `reports/pic-submissions/YYYY-QN-ms-financial.xlsx` — a filled copy of the PIC-provided form. This is the deliverable sent to the PIC Project Manager by the 20th.

Also produce a `reports/claims/YYYY-QN.yaml` record per the schema (under `project-state` locking).

Hand off to `project-claim-prep` for the detailed PIC-form assembly; this skill produces the narrative wrapper.

## Ad-hoc status

The user says "status update for X" — produce a paragraph or two tailored to the audience:
- PIC Project Manager → formal, milestone-anchored, cautious on at-risk items
- Consortium Member internal → technical + honest
- Board / exec → outcomes + risks + asks

Save to `reports/adhoc/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Offer to hand off to `project-notifier` for Gmail draft.

## Dashboard snapshot

One page. Designed for a glance. Sections: phase + gate, health, milestones table, upcoming deadlines, top 3 risks, last 5 activity events. Saved to `reports/adhoc/snapshot-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Discipline

- **Never invent facts.** If `percent_complete` isn't current, report the last known value and flag the staleness. Do not estimate.
- **Health ratings come from state, not vibes.** Override only if the caller provides an explicit reason; log the override.
- **Sources are traceable.** Every number in a report is backed by a file in `.project-state/`. Reports reference that file by id in a footnote when depth matters.
- **Pre-publication review.** If a report will go public (blog, press), route through `project-publications` for the 30/14-day SC review per MPA.

## Integration

- **project-state** — reads everything; writes `reports/` entries and bumps counters via state.
- **project-milestone-manager** — primary milestone data source.
- **project-phase-gate** — current phase + gate pending items.
- **project-change-register** — pending / recent changes for SC pack and weekly.
- **project-claim-prep** — does the detail work for quarterly claims.
- **project-doc-suite-generator** — shares docx/xlsx rendering primitives; produces baseline report bundles.
- **project-notifier** — routes the finished report to Slack, Gmail draft, or Calendar hold.
- **project-blog-publisher** — downstream consumer for public-friendly progress.
