description: "CRUD project milestones, update percent complete and technical progress narrative, flag at-risk or blocked milestones, and regenerate the tracking xlsx from the YAML source of truth. Use this skill whenever the user says 'update M03', 'milestone status', 'how's M05 going', 'mark M01 complete', 'what milestones are at risk', 'recompute overall percent complete', 'list milestones', 'add a new deliverable to M07', 'assign owner to M12', 'regenerate the milestones tracker', or any request to read or write milestone state. Also trigger when project-status-reporter needs milestone data for a weekly report or SC pack, when project-funder-reporting needs % complete + technical_progress for the quarterly claim, when project-phase-gate checks whether gate milestones are done, or when project-change-register needs to know which milestones a change affects. PIC requires technical_progress + percent_complete per milestone on every claim — this skill owns that surface."

# Project Milestone Manager

## Purpose

Milestones are the spine of a PIC-funded project. The Master Project Agreement's Schedule A lists them; quarterly claims report progress against them; Steering Committee meetings review them; final reports close them out. This skill is the single interface for everything milestone-related.

Per PIC PM Guide, the two fields that *must* be reported on every milestone every quarter are:
- `percent_complete` — integer 0–100
- `technical_progress` — narrative string describing what was accomplished

Every other field (planned/actual dates, deliverables, owner, budget category, status, at-risk reason) supports those two.

## Trigger phrases (priority order)

1. "update M03" / "update milestone M03"
2. "mark M01 complete" / "M05 is done"
3. "what milestones are at risk?"
4. "list milestones" / "show me the milestone status"
5. "how's M05 going?"
6. "assign owner to M12" / "M07's owner is Jane"
7. "add a deliverable to M04"
8. "recompute overall percent complete" / "project health"
9. "regenerate the milestones tracker" / "rebuild tracking/milestones.xlsx"
10. Any `project-*` skill fetching milestone data

## Operations

### `list_milestones(filter?)`

Read every file under `milestones/`. Return an array sorted by id. Optional filters:
- `status: planned | in_progress | at_risk | complete | blocked`
- `owner_short: "OrgA" | "OrgB"`
- `proposal_phase: "Phase 1 – ..."` (loose match)
- `at_risk: true` (shortcut for status in {at_risk, blocked})

Output fields: `id, title, owner_short, planned_start, planned_end, percent_complete, status, at_risk_reason`.

### `get_milestone(id)`

Read one milestone file and return the full parsed YAML.

### `create_milestone(...)`

Rarely needed — we seeded 13 at scaffold. Use when Schedule A is amended via Change Order to add a milestone. Require:
- `id` (Mxx format, next available)
- `title`
- `owner_org`, `owner_short`
- `description`
- `planned_start`, `planned_end`
- `completion_criteria`
- `mpa_reference` — reference to Schedule A position

Filename: `M<NN>-<kebab-slug>.yaml` where `<NN>` matches the MPA Schedule A number.

### `update_milestone(id, fields)`

The most-used operation. Common field updates:

| User says                              | Fields updated                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "M03 is 40% done, pilot batches 5-10 complete" | `percent_complete: 40`, `technical_progress: "Pilot batches 5-10 complete. Batches 1-4 pending rework on sensor calibration."` (always append date context if missing) |
| "M05 is at risk — waiting on M04 data" | `status: at_risk`, `at_risk_reason: "Blocked on M04 labeled dataset completeness."` |
| "M01 is done"                          | `status: complete`, `percent_complete: 100`, `actual_end: <today>` |
| "M07 started today"                    | `status: in_progress`, `actual_start: <today>`          |
| "Jane from OrgB now owns M11"          | `owner_person: <slug-of-person-record>` (create people entry if missing via project-state) |

All writes go through `project-state` for locking + logging. Event names:
- `milestone.created`
- `milestone.updated` (default)
- `milestone.completed` (when `status: complete` set)

### `check_at_risk()`

Surface milestones that need attention. Rules:
- `status in {at_risk, blocked}` → always
- `status == in_progress AND planned_end - today < 14 days AND percent_complete < 70` → "behind schedule"
- `status == planned AND planned_start < today` → "late start"
- Any milestone with stale `technical_progress` (not updated in 30 days) while `status == in_progress` → "stale progress"

Return a prioritized list with reasons and suggested actions.

### `compute_overall_progress()`

Return:
- Weighted overall % complete (weight each milestone equally unless budget weights are available from Schedule A)
- Count by status
- Count by owner org
- Count by proposal phase
- "On-track?" — green if all `in_progress` milestones are on or ahead of schedule; yellow if any behind; red if any blocked

Store the result under `state.json:health` via `project-state`, which logs `health.assessed`.

### `regenerate_tracker()`

Build/refresh `tracking/milestones.xlsx` from the YAML source:
- One row per milestone
- Columns: id, title, owner_org, proposal_phase, planned_start, planned_end, actual_start, actual_end, percent_complete, status, at_risk_reason, technical_progress, completion_criteria
- Add a conditional-format traffic-light column based on `check_at_risk()` output
- Second sheet: summary (count by status, owner, phase; overall %)

Use the `xlsx` skill for the heavy lifting; do not write xlsx from scratch. The xlsx is a *view* — the YAML remains source of truth.

Event logged: `tracking.regenerated` with `target: "milestones.xlsx"`.

## Discipline rules

- **Never silently accept a 0%→100% jump without a completion event.** If `percent_complete` is set to 100, `status` must become `complete` and `actual_end` must be set.
- **Never let `percent_complete` go backward.** If an update would decrease it, require an explicit user confirmation and append a note to `technical_progress` explaining the regression.
- **Always update `technical_progress` when `percent_complete` changes.** If the user provides a number but no narrative, ask them for one line of context. PIC requires the narrative.
- **Require `at_risk_reason` when `status` becomes `at_risk` or `blocked`.**
- **Don't edit `completion_criteria` casually.** That text is from the MPA Schedule A. Edits to it require a Change Order.
- **Respect ownership.** If asked to update a milestone owned by a different organisation, warn and suggest confirming with the owner before making changes.

## Integration with other skills

- **project-state** — all writes route through it.
- **project-status-reporter** — pulls milestone state for weekly reports, SC packs, and quarterly claims.
- **project-funder-reporting** — pulls `percent_complete` + `technical_progress` per milestone at quarter-close for the PIC MS & financial tracking form.
- **project-phase-gate** — may reference milestone completion as a gate-out criterion (e.g., M13 complete → closeout gate opens).
- **project-change-register** — when a milestone is added/subtracted or its timeline shifts ≥3 months, that's a material change requiring a Change Order.

## Worked example

**User:** "Mark M01 as 60% complete — we got the first year of historical data loaded and the baseline cycle time and yield validated. Still waiting on the two energy-consumption datasets."

**Skill:**
1. Read `milestones/M01-cdi-data-readiness.yaml`.
2. Update:
   - `percent_complete: 60`
   - `technical_progress: "Year 1 historical data loaded and integrated. Baseline cycle time and yield KPIs validated and approved. Remaining: Year 2/Year 3 energy consumption datasets expected by 2026-04-25."`
   - `last_modified: <now>`, `last_modified_by: <user>`
3. Call project-state to acquire lock, write, release, log `milestone.updated` with summary.
4. Run `check_at_risk()` — M01 is 60% with 7 days to planned_end; returns "behind schedule" (60% with only 14 days to reach 100% is tight but achievable).
5. Offer to also update the tracking xlsx.
6. Return updated entity + at-risk status.
