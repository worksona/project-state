description: "Bridge project state to the scsiwyg blog — draft progress posts from milestone completions, monthly briefs, and ad-hoc stories. Respects the MPA 30/14-day Steering Committee publication review clock before anything goes public. Use whenever the user says 'blog post about M02 completion', 'draft a progress post', 'scsiwyg', 'post this to the blog', 'publish the milestone story', 'what should we blog about', 'update the project blog', 'announce M05 publicly', 'write up this quarter', 'public post about the project', 'share with the community', or any request to publish project content beyond team-internal channels. Team-internal posts ship directly; consortium posts require consortium review; public posts require full 30/14-day SC review."

# Project Blog Publisher

## Purpose

Progress announcements are a key part of PIC-funded project communications — both for funding acknowledgement (PIC + ISED) and for ecosystem visibility. This skill turns state into posts.

It respects the MPA publication discipline: every public post must go through the 30/14-day Steering Committee review before it goes out. Abstract-level posts get 14 days; full content posts get 30. Team-internal posts are exempt; consortium-level posts use a lighter review.

## Trigger phrases

- "blog post about [milestone]"
- "progress post" / "public update"
- "post to scsiwyg" / "publish the post"
- "update the project blog"
- "announce [something] publicly"
- "write up Q2" / "write up this sprint"
- "what should we blog about"

## Audience tiers

Three tiers drive review rules and publishing targets:

| Tier       | Distribution         | Review clock   | Handled by                |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Team       | Internal only        | None           | Direct publish (private)  |
| Consortium | Consortium members   | Lightweight (SC Chair ack) | Consortium-only scsiwyg or access-limited post |
| Public     | Open web             | 30 days full / 14 days abstract (per MPA) | Full SC review → publish  |

The tier is set in `manifest.yaml:surfaces.scsiwyg.blog_audience` as a default, but each post can override.

## Operations

### `suggest_topics()`

Scan state for blog-worthy moments:
- Milestone completions (especially the project-phase transitions — P1 done, P2 done…)
- Decisions with public interest (technology choice, partner engagement)
- Publications cleared for public (cross-link)
- Quarterly summaries
- Ecosystem collaborations (PIC cluster events, conference talks)

Return a ranked list with proposed angle, suggested tier, and state references.

### `draft(topic, tier)`

1. Pull relevant state (milestone, decision, quarter summary) via `project-state`.
2. Produce a draft `.md` in `communications/blog-drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "..."
   tier: team|consortium|public
   state_refs: [M02-a47-data-infrastructure, decision-2026-05-01-cloud-choice]
   status: drafted
   sc_review_started: ~
   sc_review_ends: ~
   approved_for_tier: ~
   published_url: ~
   ---
   ```
3. Include PIC + ISED funding acknowledgement on any public post. Per PIC PM Guide §Communications: "Consortium Members will endeavor to include a funding acknowledgement to PIC and ISED in any Publications and the contributions of other members of the Consortium."
4. For public posts, add a call-out: "This draft is subject to the 30-day SC review clock per MPA §Publications."

### `start_review(draft_id)`

For consortium or public tier:
1. Transition draft `status: under_review`.
2. Set `sc_review_started` to today; compute `sc_review_ends` (today + 30 days full, + 14 days abstract).
3. Via `project-notifier`:
   - Gmail draft to SC designates + PIC PM (for public) with the draft attached
   - Slack post to `alerts` channel
4. Call `project-external-comms` to register as a formal publication proposal (it tracks the clock and the SC review record).

### `publish(draft_id, url_slug?)`

1. Confirm SC review clock is either satisfied (public) or N/A (team).
2. Use `mcp__scsiwyg__create_post` with the markdown body, title, and tags.
3. Update the draft frontmatter: `status: published`, `published_url`, `published_date`.
4. Via `project-notifier`, post a Slack update and — for public posts — offer Gmail/X (Twitter) announcement drafts via the scsiwyg shares surface.
5. Log `publication.published` via `project-state`.

### `revise(draft_id, feedback)`

If SC review returns revisions, increment version and re-start the review clock per MPA terms.

## MPA publication discipline

- **30 days for full publications; 14 days for abstracts.** These are from PIC PM Guide / MPA.
- **SC must review before public posts.** No exceptions — this is an MPA obligation.
- **If IP or trade secrets are at stake**, the Publishing Party must delay to allow patent filing or remove the sensitive content. `project-external-comms` enforces this; this skill defers to it.
- **Public posts need PIC + ISED funding acknowledgement.** Add a standard footer block to every public draft.
- **No party may publish another party's data/info without consent.**

## Discipline

- **Team > consortium > public is a one-way upgrade.** A public-tier post can be distributed to team first; a team-tier post cannot jump to public without the review cycle.
- **Never auto-publish a public post.** Even with the 30-day clock satisfied, stop at a draft for explicit user go-ahead.
- **Include state references.** Every post should trace back to specific `.project-state/` entities so its claims are verifiable.
- **Announcements cannot pre-empt PIC's press.** Per PIC PM Guide §First Steps: "projects cannot be announced prior to PIC's press release or announcement date for the project." The skill blocks public posts until `manifest.yaml` records a PIC announcement date.

## Integration

- **project-state** — reads milestones, decisions, publications; writes drafts.
- **project-external-comms** — formal publication tracker (SC review clock, patent delay rules).
- **project-status-reporter** — source of narrative material (weekly/monthly/quarterly summaries).
- **project-notifier** — Slack / Gmail distribution of drafts and published posts.
- **project-milestone-manager** — milestone-completion is a common blog trigger.
- **scsiwyg MCP** — final publish via `mcp__scsiwyg__create_post` and sharing via `mcp__scsiwyg__share_to_twitter`.
